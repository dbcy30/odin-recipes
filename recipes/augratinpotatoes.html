    <h2>Creamy au Gratin Potatoes Recipe</h2>
    <p>These au gratin potatoes are my husband's favorite, he considers it a special occasion every time I make them! The creamy cheese sauce and tender potatoes in this classic French dish make a delicious flavor combination. Serve potatoes au gratin with a roast pork loin or beef tenderloin, alongside a green salad.</p>

        <li>Potatoes: This recipe starts with thinly sliced Russet potatoes. You can substitute Yukon gold, if you like.</li>
